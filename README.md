This tool is a webapp that gathers information about a last.fm user's listening habits (songs listened to per day, organized by month) and displays it as a heatmap.
The output heatmap is organized into tiles with the rocket_r colour pallette from the seaborn library.
The heatmap is log adjusted so that a day where there is an abnormal ammount of songs played does not affect the visual representation of the others excessively.
White boxes represent days where no music or songs where listened to.

NOTE: I have to login to heroku for the web app to be accessible to others.

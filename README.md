This tool is a webapp that gathers information about a last.fm user's listening habits (songs listened to per day, organized by month) and displays it as a heatmap. 
The heatmap is log adjusted so that a day where there is an abnormal ammount of songs played does not affect the visual representation of the others. 
White boxes represent when no songs are listened to for.

NOTE: I have to login to heroku for the web app to be accessible to others.
